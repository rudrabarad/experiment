## Self Satisfaction 🙌

I am 80% satisfied this week because I know there were places where I could have done better or could have completed a work bit earlier but due to some personal reason was a bit off-track this week 😓 

## Work done in this week 📰

- Completed this task

- Watched tutorials for next feature

## Planning vs Implementation :paperclip:

- I accomplished almost all the things that were on my schedule but 1 or 2 were done after the deadline which I gave to myself, but will take care of that from next time

- There were many things that were not in my schedule like abc but somehow managed it with the help of other team members 

## Positives :+1:

- It helped me increase my pqr skill

- Learnt this thing

- Helped in understanding particular concept

## Negatives :-1:

- As told earlier too that was not able to do few tasks on time which I'll keep in mind 

- There were few mistakes, technical errors and also some run time errors which I'll take as a learning and keep that in mind for future events

## Next week goals ✍🏻 

My next week goals are as follows :

- To do this

- To complete that
